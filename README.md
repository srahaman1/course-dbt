# Analytics engineering with dbt; a course by co:rise

Hello! Welcome to the repository I created when I took the Analytics Engineering course to learn about analytics
engineering and dbt basics. 

In this course, we used dbt via Gitpod.io connected to database via temporary Snowflake instance from the course,
which is no longeravailable,for the course. To see the files and code I built during this course, please see the
**greenery folder**.

This humble and imperfect repository serves as my first step milestone in my dbt journey.
